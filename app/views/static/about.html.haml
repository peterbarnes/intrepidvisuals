      Hi!&nbsp; My name is Peter Barnes, I am a photographer and videographer from Lincoln, Nebraska!&nbsp; I'm 18 years old and currently a computer-engineering major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln!&nbsp; I love taking pictures and meeting cool people while I do so!&nbsp; When someone shoots with me, they aren't just a client, they are a friend, and I want to make sure that all of my friends are comfortable and have a good time!&nbsp;

      Other than photo & video I'm into pizza, music, web development, programming, and anything nerdy or geeky!&nbsp; I also love animals. Like a lot.

      At the end of the day I just want to photograph cool things whether it be pictures of you or pictures of your dog!
